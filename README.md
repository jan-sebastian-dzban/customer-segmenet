# customer-segmenet
In this notebook I will try to find a possible customer segmenetation enabling to classify customers according the their different purchases. I hope this information will be useful for the next prediction task. 
Since there are thousands of products in the dataset I will rely on aisles, which represent categories of products. Even with aisles features will be too much so I will use Principal Component Analysis to find new dimensions along which clustering will be easier. I will then try to find possible explanations for the identified clusters.
